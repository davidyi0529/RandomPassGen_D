# RandomPassGen_D

<br />

RandomPassGen_D is a password generator that randomly generates a password based on criteria that the user provides when prompted. 

The user will begin by pressing the "Generate Password" button. The first prompt will ask the user for their desired length of the password between the range of 0-128. If the user provides a number outside of the range, they will be prompted to enter a number within the valid password length range. It will continue to loop until a valid number is entered.

The following prompts will confirm if they would like to include lowercase and/or uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If the user selects none to all criteria, they will be asked to at least select one criteria. The prompts will continue to loop until a criteria is selected.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.
