# RandomPassGen_D

<br />

RandomPassGen_D is a password generator that randomly generates a password based on criteria that the user provides when prompted. 

The user will begin by pressing the "Generate Password" button. The first prompt will ask the user for their desired length of the password between the range of 0-128. If the user provides a number outside of the range, they will be prompted to enter a number within the valid password length range. It will continue to loop until a valid number is entered.

The following prompts will confirm if they would like to include lowercase and/or uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If the user selects none to all criteria, they will be asked to at least select one criteria. The prompts will continue to loop until a criteria is selected.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.

## Features

<br />
<br />

I would like to discuss some of the key features used for this project. The following tools below were mainly used without using any media queries.

- `HTML`
- `Bootstrap`

Since Bootstrap was able to provide a basic layout to get started, it was just a matter of research of putting the building blocks together.

<br />

>Bootstrap features utilized...

- `Navbar` - This component was used for the top and bottom bars.
- `Card` - Used in the main **About me** page and **Portfolio** page. Since this was mainly use in the body of the page, 
           there was a lot of trial and error on the spacings.
- `Grids`
- `Input group`
- `Forms`
- `Colors`

<br />

There are a lot of cool features that Bootstrap can provide and I can't wait to utilize it more in future projects.
